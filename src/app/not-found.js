            “We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never
            going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who
            could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day
            outnumber the sand grains of Arabia. Certainly those unborn ghosts include
            greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because
            the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of
            actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our
            ordinariness, that are here. We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth
            against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state
            from which the vast majority have never stirred?”
