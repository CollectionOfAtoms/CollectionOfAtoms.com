### The Case For The Most Important Value

You may be here because you found my site on my socials, or because I shared this blog post with you directly.  Maybe you are here because I put my website in a job application or shared a link online.  Whatever the case, I want to thank you for taking the time to read some of my thoughts.  We can't make more time; we can only save it, so thank you for being here and using yours generously.  

For my part, I am here to communicate to you something worthwhile.  If you are here reading this far and with attention enough to make it through the first paragraph, I humbly ask you to gather a piece of paper and a writing utinsil as you follow along.

In this article I will be asking you to stop and participate before continuing onward.  I write this with the intention of making an impact on you, reader. If you don't have the time or patience, please come back later when you have space for it.   

## The Purpose of Life

As we begin, I'd like you to consider your own life. What brings purpose and meaning to your life? In this post I won't be touching on religious beliefs, so for the moment I'd like you to consider those earthly experiences that bring a sense of meaning for to your life. This can be as simple as 'art', 'my dog', or 'watching a beautiful sunset', or as complex as 'protecting and nurturing my family'. For me, I find often that meaning is chiefly related to moments of great beauty, connection or enjoyment.

Take a moment now and write a short list of the most important earthly things that bring you value to your own life. 

Just a few items will do. Your list doesn't need to be a comprehensive one of every possible thing that you can list. Once you have at three or four or five items listed out, come back and continue reading.  

If you have trouble writing even one item on your list, this is a sign of a depressed mental state.  It's okay to be there, and I have been there myself many times throughout my life. But if you are there, the rest of this exercise isn't going to land, and may cause you to even experience shame or guilt that certainly won't be productive for the change I hope to make or for your own internal experience.  If this is you, come back later.  You haven't always felt this way, and there will be a time in your future where this is easy. 

## What Is Behind The Value?

Most people, I find, answer this question like myself.  They frequently have items on their lists central to their their most cherished.  'Spending time with the people I love', 'raising my children', 'being a good friend', 'being dependable' and 'making the world a better place' are frequently on the list.  Others write about their personal enjoyment 'seeing the world', 'experiencing beauty', 'experiencing new things' and the like are also frequent.  

What we don't usually see are purposes surrounding novelty like 'being the first humans to experience climate change' or 'killing whomever I need to to protect my family' though many of us alive today imagine vividly a future where resources are less abundant.  This is because the core value is usually rooted around experience itself or family iteslf, rather than the specifics of what is being experienced or what must be done to protect our families. 

### Why Every Value On Your List Depends On The Environment. 

Here is my list:  

- Love
- My Dog Nibbler
- My Friends
- My Brother
- Sunsets
- Sitting with my face in the sunlight, with all my needs met in the moment beside a stream.

Yours is surely different but I'd bet it shares those core thematic tendencies with my own: it is centered around your own experience or the experiences of others, especially propagating love and enjoyment.  

So why are all those values secretly environmentalism?  

Well consider the <i>reductio-ad-absurdum</i> first: If the habitable environment of earth were truly lost, there would be no you.  There would be no friends or Nibbler or Brother.  There would be a Sunset, but there would be no me to enjoy it.  What about your list, do any of your earthly experiences of meaning transend the death of the environment?

I'm willing to wager that the answer is no.  

It is clear then that all we value depends in some way on our ability to survive which depends on our environment.

We've bounded the problem: Somewhere between the current state of the environment, and the total destruction of the habitable planet lies the destruction of meaning.

So where does that line lie, and how can we peel back this pessimistic lower bound?
