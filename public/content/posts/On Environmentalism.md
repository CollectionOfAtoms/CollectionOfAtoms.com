### The Case For The Most Important Value

You may be here because you found my site on my socials, or because I shared this blog post with you directly.  Maybe you are here because I put my website in a job application or shared a link online.  Whatever the case, I want to thank you for taking the time to read some of my thoughts.  We can't make more time; we can only save it, so thank you for being here and using yours generously.  

For my part, I am here to communicate to you something worthwhile.

In this article I will be asking you to stop and participate before continuing onward and it is important to me on a personal level that you stop and reflect on what I am asking. I write this with the intention of making an impact on you, dear reader. If you don't have the time or patience, please come back when you have space for it.

## The Purpose of Life

As we begin, I'd like you to consider your own life. What brings purpose and meaning to your life? In this post I won't be touching on religious beliefs, so for the moment I'd like you to consider those earthly experiences that bring a sense of meaning for to your life. This can be as simple as 'art', 'my dog', or 'watching a beautiful sunset', or as complex as 'protecting and nurturing my family'. I find, in my own life, that meaning is often related to moments of great beauty, connection or enjoyment, especially when shared.

If you have trouble writing even one item on your list, this is a sign of a depression. It's okay to be there, and I have been there myself many times throughout my life. But if you are there when reading this, the rest of this exercise isn't going to land, and may cause you to even experience shame or guilt that certainly won't be productive for the change I hope to make or for your own internal experience. If this is you, come back later. You haven't always felt this way, and there will be a time in your future where this is easy.

## What Is Behind The Value?

"How many other answer this question like myself?" I wonder. How many have items on their lists central to their most cherished.  'Spending time with the people I love', 'raising my children', 'being a good friend', 'being dependable'.  How many extend that to the world is 'making the world a better place' part of it?  Others write about their personal enjoyment 'seeing the world', 'experiencing beauty', 'experiencing new things' .  

What we don't usually see are purposes surrounding novelty like 'being the first humans to experience climate change' or 'protecting my family by any means necessary' though many of us alive today can imagine vividly a future where resources are less abundant.  This is because the core value is usually rooted around an experience itself or the family iteslf, rather than the specifics of what is being experienced or what may be done to protect our families. 

### Why Every Value On Your List Depends On The Environment. 

Here is my list:

[[meaning:list-custom title="Here is my list" entries="Love | My dog, Nibbler | My friends | My brother | Sunsets | Sitting with my face in the sunlight, with all my needs met in the moment beside a stream."]]

Yours is surely different but I'd bet it shares those core thematic tendencies with my own: mine is centered around my own experience or the experiences of others on this planet, especially propagating love and enjoyment.  

[[meaning:list title="List" description="This is the list you built so far."]]

So why are all those values secretly environmentalism?  

Let's start by bounding the problem: consider the _reductio-ad-absurdum_ first: If the habitable environment of earth were truly lost, there would be no you.  There would be no friends or Nibbler or Brother. There would be a Sunset, but there would be no me to enjoy it.  What about your list, do any of your earthly experiences of meaning transcend the death of the environment?

[[meaning:select_environmental title="Values tied to environment" description="Tap items that depend on the environment." comment="What about this depends on the environment?"]]

So we have to split it up. 

[[meaning:list_non_environmental title="Values less tied to environment" description="These were not marked as environmentally dependent." comment="Optional note"]]


It is clear then that all we value depends in some way on our ability to survive which depends on our environment.



We've bounded the problem: Somewhere between the current state of the environment, and the total destruction of the habitable planet lies the destruction of meaning.

So where does that line lie, and how can we peel back this pessimistic lower bound?  

## Survival is not Enough

The picture of the world today is unfortunately grim. We alive in 2026 have an unusual and unprescedented circumstance.  We find ourselves living in a world with a balooning population that presents an existential risk to the planet.  We didn't ask to be born into this world and no person is responsible for this predicament, but rather the agregate choices of us all.  

The average global temperature is warming. Old growth forests are being destroyed. The biosphere is losing biodiversity. Global soil quality is on the decline. The oceans are becoming more acidic.

### Human Continuation

A lot of people, when considering some pessimistic version of the future think that one day nuclear proliferation will lead to the end of all human life. I'm here to convince you that this is not the case. Humans, of all animals on the planet are among the most likely to survive a nuclear proliferation event. Humans can see it coming. Humans can prepare. Humans can farm and gather new information and adapt our entire lifestyles to changing conditions where other animals cannot. And some of us will. Biology will continue until the planet disallows it, but the future that is built will be subject to the constraints that we have given it.  

For the vast majority of those alive today, such an event would represent the end of a lot of meaning, either in that they will be dead, or in that those they love or the hopes for their future dreams will be destroyed alongside the loss of so much of the environment. 

### Human Flourishing

On the other hand our imaginations also let us imagine pictures of human flourishing.  The 'Star Trek' future may still be in our grasp.  Perhaps we, with our kind's great intellect, manage to solve the issues facing us.  Maybe we manage to preserve not only our lives, but our planet, and pass on a comfortable and habitable environment deep into the future. 

### Meaning Under Scarcity

## Responding To The Present Moment

[[meaning:add title="Expand your list?" description="Thinking about meaning made me realize how many things I have to live for. I invite you to think about it for a moment longer.  We won't be diving more deeply into these, but I found it helpful to keep writing mine out." placeholder="There's more to life than you thought" comment="Why?"]]

## Conclusion
- Thank reader. 
- Tie it back to action in life. 'Given that so much that brings meaning to our lives relies on the environment, are you willing to take action in your own life in order to protect the environment.  In other words: are you willing to call yourself an environmentalist?  Are your actions aligned with your values?
