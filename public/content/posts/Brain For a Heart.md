# Brain For A Heart

[[subtitle text="What’s with the logo?"]]

This mark is about refusing a false choice: between thinking deeply and caring deeply.

## Atom

The atom represents the invisible unit of our world. Unintuitively, we find *everything* composed of the same building blocks — a hidden relationship underlying it all. As we find ways to look deeper and elucidate what is really going on, we are often surprised by what we discover.

Without atoms to compose us, there could be no heart to sustain us.

## Heart

The heart represents the animal capacity to love and feel — the essential core of every mammal, bird, fish, amphibian, and reptile. Colored in earth tones, it calls back to our shared home.

Without a heart to pump our blood, there could be no brain to guide us.

## Brain

The brain represents the human ability for higher thinking. It is the force that shapes the world we live in — for better or worse. The brain reflects those abilities that are uniquely human: understanding and interrogating our world deeply, responding thoughtfully to what we discover, and communicating across vast scales and with high fidelity.

Without a brain to question the world curiously, the atom may as well not exist.

This logo is a reminder to think clearly, feel honestly, and remember what we’re made of.
