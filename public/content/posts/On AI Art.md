# AI Art Has Changed The Way We See Art

<!-- Cat wall image here -->

It's been a few years now since the advent of AI generated art and music.
Our world, for better or worse, is changed now.

## What I Thought In 2022

I have been following the progress of OpenAI since 2018 with a lot of anticipation.
I was fascinated by machine learning and the breakneck pace of advancement.
I was amazed at how many applications they had, and when DALLE-2 dropped I was granted early access.

**A new creative unlock.**
The world had unlocked a new capability.
Any human, with only the ability to describe an image could create something beyond their physical skill, something that contained beauty.
There is something that I still find comforting in that, but I must admit that the original novelty has worn off.

I saw all kinds of takes at the time, where people were understandably threatened.
Threatened for their livlihood.
Many offended by the idea that a machine could create art at all.

I have never been employed as an artist, but I have made art.
I understood that affront to our egos, but was reminded of [an article that I read many years prior](https://computerhistory.org/blog/algorithmic-music-david-cope-and-emi/) in which a computer scientist generated compositions in the stlyle of Bach and Mozart, had them performed by humans.
Audiences described the music as 'beautiful and inspired' before they knew a computer had composed it but 'lifeless' and 'plain' when they knew it was created.
Surely if the difference was *knowing* that a computer produced something, then the real issue was our egos thinking so highly of our human capability.
Time and time again are we affronted when the universe reveals something false that is actually true.

**Offense doesn't equal truth.**
Galileo was exiled for showing the sun was not the center of the universe.
OpenAI is villified for showing computers can make art.
People will be upset, but that doesn't make them correct.

I enjoyed using AI to create something new and beautiful.
I even hosted a party when MidJourney first got good at creating images where we all generated photos of cats, printed them out and put them on the wall.

**A small, joyful moment.**
I remember that night as a kind of shared laughter over possibility.

I had a lot of thoughts about how we could monetize the new capability to not be in fundamental contradiction to the wellbeing of artists.
Perhaps we could devise a system where to train a model, artists could elect to have some small sum deposited in a crypto-wallet on each generation, or a way to legilsate opting out of the data collection altogether that had teeth and still think those are good ideas.

But all in all I would say that I was excited by the technology, and intrigued by its capabilities.
I wanted to see all the new and powerful things that AI could unlock for us, especially new forms of art not yet devised.
I love art.
I love a painted wall more than a white one in most settings, and I saw enormous potential for an art-saturated future.

## What I Think In 2026

### A Parallel To The Past

**A shift in the frame.**
One thing I didn't take into account at first was the way that AI art would permanently change art as a whole.

In his 1972 documentary [Ways Of Seeing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wxRxSfhw6I) Johnathan Berger makes the case that something fundamental changed about art with the invention of the camera.
Before the camera, Berger argues, art was always by design.
If you wanted to see a fresca in the 1600s you would have to enter a church or a museum.
Every person that wanted to see that painting would also have to walk the same staircases, the same hallways, and would see that painting in the same frame with the same background and the same lighting.

That is to say that the art was a fundamentally designed experience.
At that time, if you saw a painting you would know that every detail of its presentation was controlled and understood by the artist.
And if your friend told you about some wonderful artwork they had beheld, you would only have their description to imagine it by.

But with the camera and the modern printing press, classical artists lost their setting, they lost their control of intentionality.
Suddenly, images of the Mona Lisa were used as a prop to advertize in magazines and newspapers.
Today, nearly every person on earth can conjur a mental image of the Mona Lisa while few have ever seen the original artwork.
In Berger's view, this is why classical art has balooned in value.
The mystere that art once had was lost, and so we put outrageous price tags on these pieces to again make them mysterious objects of fascination.
How could a piece of art be worth millions truly?

<!-- ###  Need a name for this section -->

**A new kind of loss.**
I posit that AI art has similarly changed something about art as a whole and the way that it is consumed.
Where the camera represented a loss of control of intentionality, the AI represents a loss of intentionality itself.

**The candy rock moment.**
I find myself, like most of the species, sometimes scrolling my life away on social media with no intention behind my own actions.
And while I am scrolling, I come across a comic.
I see an apparent narrative arc, but the words make no sense.
The algorithm has given my dopamine-addicted brain a morsel to chew on, and it seeks to understand.

But as I look it becomes clear: the comic is AI, and not just in structure, but in total.
Every comment comes from a fresh account only minutes old and the image itself is just nonsense.
And what's more is that I stopped and tryed to parse the image.
I sent the signal to send me more things like this.
Social media wants me doing this to maximize ad revenue.

[[daily-comic caption="This image is generated anew every day. Maybe it's sensical, maybe it's not. I have never seen it. When I choose to place it in front of you, it is now using your precious attention and lifespan to determine whether or not it is worth making at all."]]

It was as though someone promised to give me a candy but instead handed me a sugar-coverd rock.
Realizing the way in which I was being manipulated caused me to regroup and put down my phone.
It really got me thinking.

Before AI art, all art we would see, no matter how small only existed because some human somewhere had had sat down and used some sliver of their lifespan creating it.
But now, a marketer with no artistic skill or intention, can create infinite art and put it in front of your eyes for you to react to.
And they will.

This phenomenon will not stop at digital and printed media.
Today there are already [products on the market](https://www.robohood.com/about-robohood/robotic-art-studio-suite-product) that can create physical art with minimal human input.
As time goes on the line between intentional art and unintentional art will blur.

Do not get me wrong: the endeavor to automate art is an art form of its own.
I could imagine truly intentional uses for such a machine, and new capabilities realized from it.
But this new form of art has a new ability: it can pass itself off as being intentional when there was no intent.

I hadn't given due credit to art before, but by its very nature it bestowed a Trust (Capital T) – Trust enough that the artist thought it was worthwhile to create.
And now that Trust is being hijacked.

We can no longer just go through our lives believing that what we are beholding has a true human intention behind it.

## How Can We Reclaim Art?

**The good news is we still have choices.**
The reality is that we can choose to not make use of this tool in our creative processes when it is not necessary.
Just as the camera did not remove our ability to designate camera-free spaces and generate art that could not be captured in photograph, AI does not remove our ability to use our human intention to direct artistic output.

If you are similarly afflicted, and desire trust in art as a window for human connection;
Where art once again communicates the thoughts of people – where beholding it instantly transports us across time and space, back to an actual moment that another human experienced.
Then we have a few levers we can pull.

### Change The Culture

I don't want "No AI ever" and I don't feel alone in my admiration for some AI capabilities.
There are places where AI makes sense to use.
I use it for making programming accessible (as is the case for much of this site.)

However, there are places where AI art is not needed or wanted.
When a marketer uses an AI image to avoid paying someone that took stock photos, that sucks.
When propagandists make doorcam videos of crimes that never happened and get people pumping cortisol through their veins over something that never happend, that sucks.

I think we can build support around causes like this and legislate specific use cases.
To do this we would have to have some common understanding of where the line is for using AI art and aligning ourselves with that ideal.

### Change Ourselves

I think we can make a commitment for the ways we will use art.
If we don't want this, then it is up to us to resist doing these things in our personal or professional lives.

>**I promise not to share art generated by an AI, unless I have given it specific vision and intention.**

>**I promise to not use AI to generate photorealistic images or videos of people or events.**

>**I promise not to use art generated by an AI when I could reasonably use an alternative.**

>**I will disclose the use of AI wherever I use it.**

>**I will not pass off AI art as human art.**

I have broken the commitment by making the element on this page to make a point.
We're not going to be perfect.
Our world is crazy.
But by divesting ourselves from these malicious use cases, we pave the way to legislate.

If you see the value in what I'm saying then consider making the commitment.
There's no club, but if you are serious about it, then I suggest you get out a pen and paper, write these commitments down and sign them.

**A short ending.**
I don't think the answer is fear.
I think the answer is attention.
If we can choose where to place it, we can keep art human.
